Hi Codecademy graders.....

Thanks for taking the time to review my project!

One note ----

The My Times project was super awesome and really helped me learn flex-box styling. I actually feel like I have a great grasp of how to use flex-box to position elements on a page. In fact I was way more confident using that to position elements than I was using the original CSS tools of position, display, margins, and padding. I ended up deciding to try to create this site the old way to practice those skills without using flex-box which, if you understand it, is almost way too easy haha.

Let me know what you think about my code!

Thanks,
Kevin
